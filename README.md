Art History 196/296:   Art, Law, and Ethics
Course content and goals: This course addresses a broad range of ethical and legal issues   pertaining   to art, ownership, looting and   theft, museum policies, and cultural heritage. Beginning with a review of   the key international and nation laws,   this course   will   then explore a series of case-studies related   to   the collection,   trade, and display of art,   from Greek and Roman antiquities   to   Indigenous material cultural,   from paintings looted in   wartime   to photographs of   troubling or disturbing subjects.   We   will also explore   the broader ideologies connected   with   the acquisition and   display of cultural heritage, such as nationalism and the universal museum, as   well as   the role of modern museums and our ethical responsibilities as art historians.
Learning outcomes: after completing   this course, students should:
1.       Understand   the key legal   frameworks   that govern   the collection of objects of cultural   heritage as   well as   their limitations
2.       Demonstrate an awareness of ethical considerations in   the collection and display of   cultural heritage as   well as related   theoretical issues such as   the role of museums in   society, colonialism, and   nationalism
3.       Communicate   the outcomes of independent research in both oral and   written   presentations and gain skills in leading seminar discussions.
Prerequisites: none

Assessment and grading (196   – undergraduate students)
Reading responses: 35%
Participation in class discussion: 10%
Discussion leader: 10%
Case study paper presentation: 10%
Case study paper: 35%
Reading   responses:   this is a discussion-based seminar; it is   therefore essential   that   you attend all   classes, complete   the readings, submit   your reading responses, and come   to seminar prepared with questions to ask   your classmates.   Any missed classes beyond one   will result in a reduced   participation grade.   To   facilitate discussion,   you   will submit a reading response before each class.   These should include (1) a short summary of   the readings, (2) questions or observations on   these      readings, and (3) questions for group discussion.   These are not graded but should demonstrate   your engagement   with   the   text.
Discussion leader: each student   will lead part of the discussion   for one class based on either the      assigned case study OR a case study of choice.   At least five key questions or   discussion prompts must be submitted in advance. Please email me by   the end of   week 2   with   your preferred topics in   order and I   will do my best to match   you   with something   you are interested in.
Case   study   paper   presentation: includes (1) a   ten-minute presentation outlining the case study      that   you have chosen followed by (2) a question that   your case study raises   for a group discussion
Case   study   research   paper:   final papers should be around 2,500   words. Each paper should (1)   consider one specific case study (as presented in class), (2) discuss how   the   various legal and ethical concerns covered by   the course apply, and (3)   what questions may still be left open.
Workload: approximately 12 hours/week: 3 hours in class, 4 hours reading and reading response   (weekly); 1 hour discussion leader, 1 hour presentation, 3 hours case study paper (averaged over   the quarter)
Assessment and grading   (296   – graduate students)
Book reviews: 35%
Participation in class discussion: 10%
Book presentation: 10%
Research paper presentation: 10%
Research paper: 35%
Reading   responses   and   book   reviews:   the additional book readings assigned to graduate students are meant   to provide broader   theoretical perspectives on each   topic. In addition   to completing   the readings assigned to   the 196 students,   you are required to submit a short book   review (max 1000   words) on   the book (or articles) of the   week (in   weeks 2-7).
Book   presentation: each 296 student   will give a short (5 minute) presentation on their book reading   for   the 196 students during class.
Research   paper   presentation: a   ten-minute presentation outlining   your research paper and   time   for questions
Research   paper:   final papers should be around 3,500   words.   The paper should apply one or more of   the major   theoretical   topics discussed in   this course   to   your own area of research. You may   focus   on one specific object, a museum, or collection of objects, but should   focus on broader questions   surrounding the acquisition and display of cultural heritage in   your   field   rather   than   the describing an individual case study.
Workload: approximately 12 hours/week: 3 hours in class, 4 hours reading and reading response   (weekly); 1 hour book presentation, 1 hour research paper presentation, 3 hours research   paper         (averaged over   the quarter)
